*A playful interactive decision-making machine*

## 📌 Project Overview

**WhattoDo Box** is an interactive physical device designed to help users make small life decisions or break out of boredom through a ritualized, fate-like interaction. Users insert a coin, think of a question, make choices through buttons, and receive a randomly dispensed answer card — sometimes good, sometimes bad.

This project combines physical computing, mechanical design, UI on MiiPiTFT, sound & light feedback, and custom card-dispensing mechanisms into one cohesive interactive experience. The documentation is written so that if we woke up with amnesia, we could fully recreate the project from scratch.

## 💡 Big Idea

> *When you don't know what to do — ask the box.*

The WhattoDo Box reacts to a coin insertion and guides users through a step-by-step interaction that ends with a physical card revealing an answer. The randomness of the output creates a sense of **fate**, rather than correctness. The box functions as a hybrid of fortune machine, arcade-style device, motivation box, and piggy bank (coins can be saved inside).

## 🔁 Fall-Back Plan

If the full system failed, we planned several fallback options. First, we could change from dual card dispenser to single card dispenser. If that didn't work, we could replace the card dispenser with a random object dropping machine. As a last option, we could convert the physical system into a screen-only digital version. Each fallback preserves the core idea of randomized decision-making.

## 🧱 Physical Design Evolution

### From Cardboard to Laser-Cut Wood

The initial prototype was built from cardboard, but the final version uses a laser-cut wooden box. We precisely measured and cut openings for the MiiPiTFT screen, buttons, LEDs, two card exits, and rear cable exit. All components are flush with the surface, creating a clean and integrated appearance. The card exit was upgraded from one slot to two slots.

## ⚙️ Card Dispensing Mechanism

### Original Plan

The original plan used two servo motors where each servo controlled one card exit and drove a roller to push out a single card.

### Final Mechanical Design (Implemented)

To better simulate a realistic automatic card dispenser, we designed and tested a custom 3D-printed card dispensing box. The card slot holds multiple cards stacked vertically with a hollow bottom. Rollers are installed underneath the cards and connect to a small gear, then large gear, then external knob. Rotating the knob spins the rollers and pushes cards outward. This design allows multiple cards per slot instead of one card at a time.



We replaced the manual knob with a 360° continuous servo motor attached directly to the gear. Card output is controlled by setting servo rotation duration, which was calibrated through multiple rounds of testing.

### ❗ Major Problem & Solution

The surface of the 3D-printed rollers had too little friction, so cards slipped instead of being pushed out. We tried increasing card weight and adding springs on top of the cards, but these attempts failed. The final working solution was adding friction strips using rubber bands. We cut rubber bands and glued them onto the rollers with hot glue, which significantly increased friction and enabled reliable card output.

## 🔌 Hardware Setup

This section documents how all hardware components are connected, from the Raspberry Pi to sensors, LEDs, and actuators. The goal is that the system can be fully rebuilt from scratch using this description alone.

###  Main Board

The Raspberry Pi 5 acts as the central controller for logic, UI, sensing, and actuation. It runs the Python scripts that manage interaction flow, sensor readings, LED animations, servo motor timing, and sound and screen output.

### 🔗 I2C Expansion & GPIO Control

The SparkFun Qwiic GPIO is used to expand GPIO access via the I2C bus. This board simplifies wiring and allows multiple devices (LEDs, sensors) to be chained cleanly using Qwiic cables. It connects to the Raspberry Pi 5 via I2C using a Qwiic cable.

### 💡 LED Output (Visual Feedback)

Five 5V LEDs are used to visualize the waiting state after coin insertion. LEDs light up one by one while the user is thinking, and all turn on simultaneously when a card is dispensed. The LEDs are connected to Qwiic GPIO output pins and controlled through I2C commands from the Raspberry Pi.

### 📏 Distance Sensor (Coin Detection)

The SparkFun Distance Sensor (VL53L1X, Qwiic) detects when a coin passes through the slot. This sensor is critical for triggering the interaction flow. It connects from Qwiic GPIO to the Distance Sensor via Qwiic cable, communicating through I2C. Sensor readings are continuously polled by the Raspberry Pi.

### ⚙️ Servo Motor (Card Dispensing)

The 360° Continuous Rotation Servo Motor drives the gear-based card dispensing mechanism. The servo rotates for a calibrated duration to push one card out of the slot. The servo signal pin connects to Raspberry Pi GPIO (PWM), servo power connects to external 5V supply with shared ground, and servo timing (rotation duration) is controlled in software.

### 🖥️ Display & User Input

The MiiPiTFT Display is used to display instructions, prompts, and choices to the user. Buttons on the display are used for user input during the interaction flow.

### 🔊 Audio Output

The Bluetooth Speaker provides audio feedback including coin insertion confirmation sound and background mysterious music during waiting states. It pairs wirelessly with the Raspberry Pi via Bluetooth, and audio is triggered through Python scripts.


## 💻 Software Architecture

The system uses Python language. GPIO is used for LEDs and servo motor. MiiPiTFT is used for UI display and buttons. The system follows a state-based interaction flow: Idle → Coin detected → Waiting → Choice → Dispense. All code is archived in this repository.

> 🔗 **Code Archive:** *([Link to Code](https://github.com/m-lmq/Interactive-Lab-Hub/blob/Fall2025/Final/1201.py))*

## 🧩 Final Interaction Flow

In the idle state, the MiiPiTFT displays "Insert coin". When the user inserts a coin, the distance sensor detects it, an immediate sound effect confirms success, and mysterious background music starts playing. Five LEDs then light up one by one in sequence, indicating the system is waiting for user input.

The screen displays "Hold one question in your mind..." and the user presses the button corresponding to "← Yes, I'm ready." Next, two options appear on screen: Option 1 for random card output, or Option 2 to go to a precise choice page.

For Option 1, the system randomly chooses one of two card exits. For Option 2, a next screen appears with Choice A leading to Exit 1 and Choice B leading to Exit 2. Finally, the card is dispensed, all LEDs turn on simultaneously, and the card contains an answer to the user's question (positive, negative, or ambiguous).

## 🪞 Reflections

### What We Learned
We learned that mechanical friction is as important as code. Synchronization between sound, light, and motion defines user experience. Physical randomness feels more meaningful than digital randomness.

### What We Wish We Knew Earlier
We wish we knew earlier that 3D printing material properties are unpredictable, continuous servo motors require extensive calibration, and precise enclosure design saves significant debugging time later.
