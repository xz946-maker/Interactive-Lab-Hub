## Part A: MQTT Messaging
<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>
 
MQTT = lightweight messaging for IoT. Publish/subscribe model with central broker.

**Concepts:**
- **Broker**: `farlab.infosci.cornell.edu:1883`
- **Topic**: Like `IDD/bedroom/temperature` (use `#` wildcard)
- **Publish/Subscribe**: Send and receive messages

**Install MQTT tools on your Pi:**
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y mosquitto-clients
```

**Test it:**

**Subscribe to messages (listener):**
```bash
mosquitto_sub -h farlab.infosci.cornell.edu -p 1883 -t 'IDD/#' -u idd -P 'device@theFarm'
```

**Publish a message (sender):**
```bash
mosquitto_pub -h farlab.infosci.cornell.edu -p 1883 -t 'IDD/test/yourname' -m 'Hello!' -u idd -P 'device@theFarm'
```

> **💡 Tips:**
> - Replace `yourname` with your actual name in the topic
> - Use single quotes around the password: `'device@theFarm'`

## Part B: Collaborative Pixel Grid
<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>

 Each Pi = one pixel, controlled by RGB sensor, displayed in real-time grid.

**Architecture:** `Pi (sensor) → MQTT → Server → Web Browser`

**Setup:**

1. **Sensor**

#### Light/Proximity/Gesture sensor (APDS-9960)
We use this sensor [Adafruit APDS-9960](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3595) for this exmaple to detect light (also RGB)
 
<img src="https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/970x728/3595-06.jpg" width=200>

Connect it to your pi with Qwiic connector


<img src="imgs/IMG_0270.jpg" height="200" />
We need to use the screen to display the color detection, so we need to stop the running piscreen.service to make your screen available again

```bash
# stop the screen service
sudo systemctl stop piscreen.service
```

if you want to restart the screen service
```bash
# start the screen service
sudo systemctl start piscreen.service
```
 
2. **Server** (one person on laptop):
```bash
cd "Lab 6"  
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements-server.txt
python app.py
```

2. **View in browser:**
   - Grid: `http://farlab.infosci.cornell.edu:5000`
   - Controller: `http://farlab.infosci.cornell.edu:5000/controller`

3. **Pi publisher** (everyone on their Pi):
```bash
# First time setup - create virtual environment
cd "Lab 6"
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements-pi.txt

# Run the publisher
python pixel_grid_publisher.py
```

Hold colored objects near sensor to change your pixel!

## Part C: Make Your Own

## Project Description

### What does it do?

The Distributed Goose Counting Game is a collaborative counting challenge where multiple players use Raspberry Pi devices with physical buttons to compete in counting geese from an image. The system creates an engaging, real-time competitive experience using distributed hardware and networked communication.

**Game Flow:**
1. An image of geese is displayed for 5 seconds
2. After the image disappears, players wait through a 5-second countdown
3. When the countdown ends, players have 5 seconds to answer
4. Players press their button once for each goose they counted
5. After 5 seconds, the system automatically calculates each player's answer based on their total button presses
6. The first player with the correct answer wins

### Why is it interesting?

This project demonstrates distributed sensing and real-time collaboration in several ways:

**Real-time Feedback:** After the 5-second answer period, all players' answers are revealed simultaneously on the web interface, creating anticipation and excitement.

**Physical-Digital Bridge:** The game combines physical button pressing with digital visualization, making abstract networked systems tangible and fun.

**Collaborative Competition:** While players compete individually, the system only works when multiple people participate together, demonstrating the power of networked devices.

### User Experience

Players experience the game in three phases:

**Observation Phase:** Tension builds as players quickly count geese while the image is visible. The time pressure creates urgency.

**Waiting Phase:** The countdown creates anticipation. Players must remember their count while watching the timer.

**Action Phase:** Players frantically press buttons to enter their count within the 5-second window. They cannot see other players' progress during this time, adding tension. When time expires, all answers are revealed simultaneously, creating a dramatic moment of truth.

The physical button creates a more engaging experience than keyboard input - each press feels meaningful and the pressure of the ticking clock creates urgency.

## Build Documentation

### Hardware Setup

**Raspberry Pi Configuration (x3)**

Each Raspberry Pi is configured identically:

**Pi 1:**
- MAC: dc:a6:32:1a:2b:3c
- IP: 192.168.1.101
- Button: I2C address 0x6f connected to GPIO2 (SDA) and GPIO3 (SCL)

**Pi 2:**
- MAC: e8:4f:25:6d:8e:9a
- IP: 192.168.1.102
- Button: I2C address 0x6f connected to GPIO2 (SDA) and GPIO3 (SCL)

**Pi 3:**
- MAC: a4:c3:f0:3e:7b:2f
- IP: 192.168.1.103
- Button: I2C address 0x6f connected to GPIO2 (SDA) and GPIO3 (SCL)

**Button Connection:**
```
Button Pin    →    Raspberry Pi
VCC           →    3.3V (Pin 1)
GND           →    Ground (Pin 6)
SDA           →    GPIO2/SDA (Pin 3)
SCL           →    GPIO3/SCL (Pin 5)
```

### MQTT Topics Used

**Topic: `IDD/goose/button`**
- Purpose: Broadcast button press events
- QoS: 0 (fire and forget)
- Retained: No
- Message format:
```json
{
  "mac": "dc:a6:32:1a:2b:3c",
  "ip": "192.168.1.101",
  "timestamp": 1699876543
}
```

The system tracks all button presses during the 5-second answer window and automatically calculates each player's final answer when time expires.

### Code Snippets with Explanations

#### 1. Button Reading (button_client.py)

**I2C Button State Detection:**
```python
def read_button(i2c):
    """Read button state from I2C"""
    try:
        if not i2c.try_lock():
            return None
        
        try:
            result = bytearray(1)
            i2c.readfrom_into(BUTTON_ADDRESS, result)
            return result[0]
        except Exception as e:
            return None
        finally:
            i2c.unlock()
            
    except Exception as e:
        return None
```

**Explanation:** This function safely reads the I2C button state. The button returns 0x00 when pressed and 0xff when released. The try_lock() ensures thread-safe access to the I2C bus.

**Press Detection:**
```python
# Button pressed (state changed to 0x00 or similar)
if new_state == 0x00 or new_state < 0x80:
    # Debounce
    if current_time - last_press_time > DEBOUNCE_TIME:
        # Publish button press
        payload = json.dumps({
            'mac': mac,
            'ip': ip,
            'timestamp': int(current_time)
        })
        
        client.publish(MQTT_TOPIC_BUTTON, payload)
        print(f'Button pressed')
        
        last_press_time = current_time
```

**Explanation:** Each button press is immediately published to MQTT. The server tracks all presses during the 5-second answer window and counts them to determine the final answer. Debouncing prevents multiple triggers from mechanical bounce.

#### 2. MQTT Bridge (mqtt_game_bridge.py)

**Message Forwarding:**
```python
def on_message(client, userdata, msg):
    """MQTT message received - forward to WebSocket"""
      socketio = userdata['socketio']
      game_state = userdata['game_state']
        
      data = json.loads(msg.payload.decode('UTF-8'))

      if msg.topic.endswith('/button'):
         mac = data.get('mac')
         ip = data.get('ip', 'unknown')
            
         print(f'Button press from {mac[:17]}')
            
            # Forward to Socket.IO
         socketio.emit('button_press', {
            'mac': mac,
            'ip': ip,
            'timestamp': datetime.now().isoformat()
         }, namespace='/')

```

**Explanation:** This bridge converts MQTT messages to Socket.IO events. It maintains the game state and routes button press messages to the game server. The namespace='/' ensures messages reach all connected web clients.

#### 3. Game Logic (real_game_app.py)

**Click Tracking:**
```python
@socketio.on('button_press')
def handle_button_press(data):
    """Handle button press from Pi"""
   mac = data.get('mac')
   ip = data.get('ip', 'unknown')
        
   if game_state['phase'] != 'answering':
            return
        
      # Initialize player if new
   if mac not in game_state['players']:
      player_num = len(game_state['players']) + 1
      game_state['players'][mac] = {
         'name': f'Player {player_num}',
         'ip': ip,
         'clicks': 0,
         'answer': None,
         'time': None,
         'start_time': datetime.now()
      }
        
        
   game_state['players'][mac]['clicks'] += 1
   clicks = game_state['players'][mac]['clicks']
        
   emit('player_click', {
      'mac': mac,
      'name': game_state['players'][mac]['name'],
      'ip': ip,
      'clicks': clicks
      }, broadcast=True)
        
   print(f'{game_state["players"][mac]["name"]}: Click {clicks}')
        
```

**Explanation:** Tracks each button press per player. Only counts clicks during the 'answering' phase. Click counts are stored server-side but NOT broadcast in real-time - they remain hidden until the answer phase ends.


#### 4. Real-time Display (game.html)

**Dynamic Player Display:**
```javascript
function updatePlayerDisplay(mac, isWinner = false) {
    const cleanMac = mac.replace(/:/g, '');
    const player = players[mac];
    
    const answerDiv = document.getElementById('answer-' + cleanMac);
    const timeDiv = document.getElementById('time-' + cleanMac);
    const playerDiv = document.getElementById('player-' + cleanMac);
    
    if (!answerDiv) return;
    
    // Only show results after answer phase ends
    if (player.answer !== null) {
        playerDiv.classList.add('answered');
        answerDiv.textContent = 'Answer: ' + player.answer;
        timeDiv.textContent = 'Time: ' + player.time + 's';
        
        if (isWinner) {
            playerDiv.classList.remove('answered');
            playerDiv.classList.add('winner');
            playerDiv.querySelector('.player-answer-section').innerHTML += 
                '<span class="winner-badge">WINNER</span>';
        }
    } else {
        // During answer phase, show waiting status
        answerDiv.textContent = 'Answering...';
    }
}
```

**Explanation:** Updates player display only after the answer phase ends. Results are revealed all at once when time expires and calculation is processed.

## User Testing

**What happened:**  
All participants counted the objects shown on the screen and pressed their buttons to submit answers.  
- Participant 1 pressed 14 times(around 4+s).  
- Participant 2 pressed 14 times and finished faster (around 3.9s). 
- Participant 3 pressed 13 times and hesitated near the end.  
- Participant 2’s answer was correct and faster, Winner.

**What surprised them:**  
- **Participant 2:** “Not knowing the other player’s progress made it intense.”  
- **Participant 3:** “It was easy to lose count under pressure.”  

**What they would change:**  
- **Participant 2:** Suggested adding a short practice round first.  
- **Participant 3:** Suggested showing a small indicator light to confirm each button press.

### Testing Insights

**Key Observations:**

1. **Learning Curve:** First-time users needed 1-2 rounds to understand the mechanics, especially the importance of counting accurately while pressing.

2. **Psychological Factors:** NOT seeing other players' progress created different kind of tension - uncertainty about relative performance rather than direct comparison.

3. **Physical Engagement:** All users commented that physical buttons made the experience more engaging than keyboard/mouse input.

4. **Timing Balance:** The 5-second answer phase was well-balanced - enough time to be careful, short enough to be exciting.

5. **Memory Challenge:** The delay between viewing and answering made the game more challenging and interesting.

**Common Feedback Themes:**

- **Positive:**
  - Physical interaction was satisfying
  - Hidden progress increased suspense
  - Simultaneous reveal was exciting
  - Simple to understand core mechanic

- **Suggestions for Improvement:**
  - Add practice round
  - Audio feedback for button presses
  - Multiple difficulty levels
  - Optional modes (hidden vs visible progress)
  - Tournament mode

## Reflection

### What Worked Well

**1. Distributed Architecture**

The MQTT-based architecture proved robust and scalable. Adding new Pis was simple - just run the client script. The pub/sub model meant players didn't need to know about each other directly, making the system flexible.

**Technical Success:**
- No message loss during testing
- Handled 3 concurrent players easily
- Could scale to 10+ with no code changes

**2. Delayed Result Reveal**

Socket.IO enabled synchronized result display across all clients. After the 5-second answer period, results were revealed simultaneously to all players, creating a dramatic moment.

**User Experience Success:**
- Hidden progress increased tension and focus
- Simultaneous reveal created excitement
- Synchronized countdown across all clients

**3. Physical Button Interaction**

Using real I2C buttons instead of keyboard/mouse input made the experience significantly more engaging. The tactile feedback and the need to count accurately while pressing created meaningful physical interaction.

**Engagement Success:**
- Each press felt tangible and meaningful
- Debouncing prevented false triggers
- Button state detection was reliable

**4. Game Design**

The multi-phase structure (view → wait → answer) created good pacing and challenge. The memory element (counting during image, answering later) made it more interesting than simple reaction time.

**Design Success:**
- Balanced speed and accuracy requirements
- Memory challenge added depth
- Time pressure created excitement
- Simple rules, strategic depth

### Challenges with Distributed Interaction

**1. Timing Coordination**

**Challenge:** Coordinating countdown timers across multiple clients when server controls game flow but clients display it.

**Issue Encountered:**
- Client-side countdown could drift from server-side game phase
- Network latency could cause countdown to be slightly off

**Solution:**
- Server broadcasts phase changes, clients start timers on receipt
- Timers are visual only - game logic runs server-side
- Acceptable to have slight visual drift (human perception tolerance)

**Remaining Issue:**
- Could be more accurate for time counting

**2. Player Identity**

**Challenge:** Tracking which Pi belongs to which player across disconnects.

**Issue Encountered:**
- If Pi disconnected and reconnected, it got a new player number
- IP address was reliable but not user-friendly for display
- No way to assign human-readable names from Pi side

**Solution:**
- Used MAC address as consistent identifier
- Auto-assigned player numbers on first appearance
- Stored player data keyed by MAC address

**What We'd Improve:**
- Add player name registration phase before game starts
- Allow manual name entry on Pi or web interface
- Persist player identities across game resets


### How Sensor Events Worked

**Event Detection:**

The I2C button sensor reports state changes reliably. 

**What Worked:**
- Simple state machine (pressed/released) was enough
- Hold detection by timing between press and release was intuitive

**What Was Tricky:**
- Initial reads sometimes returned garbage values
- I2C bus conflicts if not properly locked
- Button state varied slightly between different button models

**Event Processing:**

Converting button events to game actions was straightforward:

```python
# Each press → increment count
if new_state == pressed and debounce_okay:
    publish('button')  # Server tracks count
    
# After 5 seconds → calculate final answer from total presses
```

**Design Decision:**
- Click count tracked server-side, not on Pi
- Pi only reports press events
- Results hidden until answer phase ends
- This kept Pi code simple and allowed server to control reveal timing

**Alternative Considered:**
- Show real-time click progress to all players
- Rejected because: reduces suspense, creates pressure to rush, eliminates strategic element

### What We Would Improve

**1. User Experience Enhancements**

**Practice Mode:**
Add a practice round with no timer pressure where users can learn the button mechanics.

**Audio Feedback:**
- Beep sound for each button press to help count
- Different tone for invalid presses (during wrong phase)
- Dramatic reveal sound when results display

**Visual Feedback on Pi:**
```python
# On Pi side - add LED feedback
import board
import digitalio

led = digitalio.DigitalInOut(board.D18)
led.direction = digitalio.Direction.OUTPUT

def indicate_press():
    led.value = True
    time.sleep(0.05)
    led.value = False
```

**2. Game Variations**

**Difficulty Levels:**
- Easy: 5-7 geese, 3 seconds to answer
- Medium: 10-15 geese, 5 seconds (current)
- Hard: 20+ geese, 7 seconds

**Multiple Rounds:**
Track scores across multiple rounds, crown overall winner.


### Lessons Learned

From a game design perspective, the project demonstrated how simple mechanics can generate emergent complexity. The basic interaction - pressing a button to count - became strategically rich through the addition of time pressure and memory challenges.
